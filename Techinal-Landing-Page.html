          HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to
          write Web Pages.
          Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like
          headings, paragraphs, lists, and so forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information
          between researchers.
          Now, HTML is being widely used to format web pages with the help of different tags available
          in HTML language.
        </p>
        As told earlier, HTML is a markup language and makes use of various tags to format the
        content. These tags are enclosed within angle braces <Tag Name>. Except few tags, most
          of the tags have their corresponding closing tags. For example, <html> has its closing
          tag
         </html> > and

          <body> tag has its closing tag </body> tag etc.
          <p>
            To learn HTML, you will need to study various tags and understand how they behave, while
            formatting a textual document. Learning HTML is simple as users have to learn the usage of
            different tags in order to format the text or images to make a beautiful webpage.
          </p>

              Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
              together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.
              As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to
              simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure
              it to display.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
              <code><!DOCTYPE></code> declaration tag is used by the web browser to understand the version of
              the HTML used in the document. Current version of HTML is 5 and it makes use of the following
              declaration:
            </li>
          </ul>

        <p>HTML elements are designated by tags. Most elements have an opening and closing tag. Opening tags precede the
          text and contain the element name enclosed by the brackets “<” and “>”. Closing tags are identical to opening
            tags, save for a backward slash that precedes the element name.

          The HTML anchor element creates a hyperlink. The anchor element requires an href attribute, which species the
          destination of the link. The destination can be another section on the same web page or another web page on
          the
          same site, or external websites, files, and email addresses.

        To get started with writing <Html>

        </Html>, open the Scratchpad and write your
        first "Hello world" Html code:
        <code><p>Hello World</p>
          </code>

        Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your
        browser!

    <section class="main-section" id="Classes">
      <header class="myHeader">Classes</header>
      <p>
        The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript
        to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name.

        In the following example we have three
      <div> elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three <div> elements will be styled
          equally according to the .city style definition in the head section:
          </p>
    </section>
    <hr>
    <section class="main-section" id="Multiple Classes">
      <header class="myHeader">Multiple Classes</header>
      <article>
        <p>
          HTML elements can belong to more than one class.

          To define multiple classes, separate the class names with a space, e.g.
          <code> <div class="city main"></code>. The element will be styled according to all the classes specified.

          In the following example, the first <code><h2> element belongs to both the city class and also to the main class, and
            will get the CSS styles from both of the classes</h2></code>
